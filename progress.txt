## Progress Log - StackCloud CSS 3D Sphere Refactor

### 2026-01-15 - RESEARCH_001 Complete

**Task:** Research CSS 3D sphere positioning algorithms

**What was done:**
1. Researched Fibonacci sphere (Golden Spiral) algorithm for even point distribution
2. Studied improved epsilon offset technique that improves packing by 8.3%
3. Researched CSS 3D transform mapping (rotateY, rotateX, translateZ)
4. Documented GPU acceleration best practices

**Key findings:**
- Golden angle = π(3 - √5) ≈ 137.508° - creates spiral pattern that never aligns into rows
- Improved distribution uses epsilon offset to push points away from poles:
  - n < 24: ε = 0.33
  - n < 177: ε = 1.33
  - n < 890: ε = 3.33
  - n ≥ 890: ε = 10
- CSS transforms (rotateY, rotateX, translateZ) run on compositor thread = 60fps smooth

**Output:**
- Created `src/components/stack-sphere/use-sphere-positions.ts` with:
  - Comprehensive algorithm documentation in JSDoc comments
  - `calculateSpherePositions()` function implementing Fibonacci sphere with epsilon offset
  - `useSpherePositions()` React hook for memoized position calculation
  - Full type definitions for SpherePosition

### 2026-01-15 - SETUP_001 Complete

**Task:** Create new CSS-only sphere component file structure

**What was done:**
1. Created component shell mirroring StackCloud interface with CSS transforms
2. Implemented StackSphere main component with Suspense wrapper
3. Implemented StackSphereItem component with memoization
4. Created CSS file with perspective, rotation animation, and reduced motion support
5. Created module index with proper exports

**Files created:**
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere.tsx` - Main sphere container with auto-rotation
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere-item.tsx` - Individual item component with a11y
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere.css` - CSS styles with GPU acceleration hints
- `src/components/stack-sphere/index.tsx` - Module exports

**Key implementation details:**
- Used existing `useSpherePositions` hook from RESEARCH_001
- Reused `extractUniqueStacks()` and `calculateStackSizeFactors()` utilities
- Integrated `useAccessibility` hook for consistent a11y support
- Applied CSS containment (`contain: paint`) for repaint isolation
- Added `will-change: auto` with conditional GPU hints
- Implemented reduced motion media query support
- Added proper ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-pressed, role)

**Preserved files (unchanged):**
- `src/data/projects.ts`
- `src/utils/stack-cloud/calculate-stack-size.ts`
- `src/utils/extract-stacks.ts`

**Status:** PASSES
