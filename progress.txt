## Progress Log - StackCloud CSS 3D Sphere Refactor

### 2026-01-15 - RESEARCH_001 Complete

**Task:** Research CSS 3D sphere positioning algorithms

**What was done:**
1. Researched Fibonacci sphere (Golden Spiral) algorithm for even point distribution
2. Studied improved epsilon offset technique that improves packing by 8.3%
3. Researched CSS 3D transform mapping (rotateY, rotateX, translateZ)
4. Documented GPU acceleration best practices

**Key findings:**
- Golden angle = π(3 - √5) ≈ 137.508° - creates spiral pattern that never aligns into rows
- Improved distribution uses epsilon offset to push points away from poles:
  - n < 24: ε = 0.33
  - n < 177: ε = 1.33
  - n < 890: ε = 3.33
  - n ≥ 890: ε = 10
- CSS transforms (rotateY, rotateX, translateZ) run on compositor thread = 60fps smooth

**Output:**
- Created `src/components/stack-sphere/use-sphere-positions.ts` with:
  - Comprehensive algorithm documentation in JSDoc comments
  - `calculateSpherePositions()` function implementing Fibonacci sphere with epsilon offset
  - `useSpherePositions()` React hook for memoized position calculation
  - Full type definitions for SpherePosition

### 2026-01-15 - SETUP_001 Complete

**Task:** Create new CSS-only sphere component file structure

**What was done:**
1. Created component shell mirroring StackCloud interface with CSS transforms
2. Implemented StackSphere main component with Suspense wrapper
3. Implemented StackSphereItem component with memoization
4. Created CSS file with perspective, rotation animation, and reduced motion support
5. Created module index with proper exports

**Files created:**
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere.tsx` - Main sphere container with auto-rotation
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere-item.tsx` - Individual item component with a11y
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere.css` - CSS styles with GPU acceleration hints
- `src/components/stack-sphere/index.tsx` - Module exports

**Key implementation details:**
- Used existing `useSpherePositions` hook from RESEARCH_001
- Reused `extractUniqueStacks()` and `calculateStackSizeFactors()` utilities
- Integrated `useAccessibility` hook for consistent a11y support
- Applied CSS containment (`contain: paint`) for repaint isolation
- Added `will-change: auto` with conditional GPU hints
- Implemented reduced motion media query support
- Added proper ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-pressed, role)

**Preserved files (unchanged):**
- `src/data/projects.ts`
- `src/utils/stack-cloud/calculate-stack-size.ts`
- `src/utils/extract-stacks.ts`

**Status:** PASSES

### 2026-01-15 - A11Y_002 Complete

**Task:** Implement keyboard navigation with roving tabindex

**What was done:**
1. Integrated existing `useRovingTabindex` hook into StackSphere component
2. Updated StackSphereItem to use `forwardRef` for focus management
3. Connected keyboard event handlers for arrow key navigation
4. Wired up tabIndex from roving tabindex hook to each item

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere.tsx` - Added useRovingTabindex integration
- `src/components/stack-sphere/stack-sphere-item.tsx` - Added forwardRef, external keydown handler

**Key implementation details:**
- Single tab stop: only one item has tabIndex=0 at a time, rest are -1
- Arrow keys (all directions) navigate between items with loop enabled
- Enter/Space selects the focused item (triggers URL filter)
- Focus ring already styled in CSS via `:focus-visible::after`
- Tab/Shift+Tab escapes the sphere to next focusable element (WAI-ARIA APG compliant)

**Accessibility features:**
- Roving tabindex pattern per WAI-ARIA APG keyboard interface guidelines
- Home/End keys jump to first/last items
- Focus automatically follows active index when using arrow keys
- Focus ring visible only on keyboard focus (not mouse)

**Status:** PASSES
