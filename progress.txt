## Progress Log - StackCloud CSS 3D Sphere Refactor

### 2026-01-15 - RESEARCH_001 Complete

**Task:** Research CSS 3D sphere positioning algorithms

**What was done:**
1. Researched Fibonacci sphere (Golden Spiral) algorithm for even point distribution
2. Studied improved epsilon offset technique that improves packing by 8.3%
3. Researched CSS 3D transform mapping (rotateY, rotateX, translateZ)
4. Documented GPU acceleration best practices

**Key findings:**
- Golden angle = π(3 - √5) ≈ 137.508° - creates spiral pattern that never aligns into rows
- Improved distribution uses epsilon offset to push points away from poles:
  - n < 24: ε = 0.33
  - n < 177: ε = 1.33
  - n < 890: ε = 3.33
  - n ≥ 890: ε = 10
- CSS transforms (rotateY, rotateX, translateZ) run on compositor thread = 60fps smooth

**Output:**
- Created `src/components/stack-sphere/use-sphere-positions.ts` with:
  - Comprehensive algorithm documentation in JSDoc comments
  - `calculateSpherePositions()` function implementing Fibonacci sphere with epsilon offset
  - `useSpherePositions()` React hook for memoized position calculation
  - Full type definitions for SpherePosition
