## 2026-01-14: URL/History Management Fix

### Task: Part 3 - URL/History Management Fix (The Big Bug!)

### Changes Made:
- `src/components/stack-cloud/stack-node.tsx:132`: Changed `router.push()` to `router.replace()`
- `src/components/stack-cloud/root-node-chart.tsx:855`: Changed `router.push()` to `router.replace()`
- `src/components/search-input.tsx:57,94,162`: Changed `router.replace()` to `router.push()`

### Rationale:
- Stack nodes and pie chart segments now use `router.replace()` - when clicking filters, you're refining the SAME view, so we don't add to browser history
- Search input now uses `router.push()` - when searching, you're making a NEW query, so back button should return to previous search

### Result:
- TypeScript type checks pass
- Back button now works correctly for search (push = add to history)
- Filter clicks don't pollute browser history (replace = stay on same history entry)

## 2026-01-14: ASCII Clouds Background

### Task: Part 4 - ASCII Clouds (The Sky Is Thinking!)

### Changes Made:
- `src/styles/globals.css`: Added `body::before` pseudo-element with ASCII cloud pattern

### Implementation Details:
- Uses SVG data URI with ASCII art cloud patterns in monospace font
- Cloud colors use Klein blue (#002FA7) to match site theme
- Very subtle opacity (0.025) for non-intrusive background effect
- Fixed positioning with `z-index: -1` to stay behind all content
- `pointer-events: none` to not interfere with interactions
- Pattern repeats seamlessly across the viewport

### Accessibility:
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` by hiding clouds
- Hidden in print mode to save ink and reduce visual noise

### Result:
- TypeScript type checks pass
- Knip passes (no unused code)
- Subtle ASCII clouds visible in background as decorative element
